# Updates On Notes

These are notes written in depth for begginers for the OpenGL repository. I'm still in the process of writing notes, so do not expect the notes to be the final version or to be finished.

I'll be updating the notes regularly so I request you to wait patiently while I do so.

That said there can be mistakes in these notes. If you spot them pls let me know so that I can make the necessary corrections. You can contact me on my instagram page - `@xplosiveginger`
