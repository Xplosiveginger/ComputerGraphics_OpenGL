# Window Creation
This note will teach you everything you need to know to render your own first window.

## Setup
Now we will setup our first project in Visual Studio.

1. If you have followed the getting started notes, you should have a visual studio project that looks like this.

        // Add image of blank project here //

2. On the right you'll have your solution explorer. In the solution Explorer you'll have a folder called `Source Files`.

        // Add image of solution explorer here //

3. Go Ahead and right click on the folder. In the context menu, Click on `Add -> Existing Item`.

        // Add image of existing item menu here //

4. A new window will open up.
        
        // Add image of existing item window here //

    Select the `glad.c` file that we put in this folder earlier. This should add the `glad.c` file as a source file in our project. This is needed because if we want to use the functions provided by the glad library we need to add the `glad.c` file.

        // Add image of solution explorer with glad.c now in the source files folder //

5. Now repeat step3 but this time instead of adding an existing item we'll be adding a new item. Click on `Add -> New Item`.

        // Add image of new item menu here //

6. In the add new item window we are gonna select `C++ File(.cpp)`. By default it is named `Source.cpp`, you can rename it to anything else, I'm going to keep it as the default name. Now click on add.

    This will add a new file called `Source.cpp`. (in my case, For you it will be what you renamed it as.)

With this our project setup is over. Now we can get to the coding part.

### Additional note:
If you think that setting up this single project was too much and are worried that we have to do that for all the projects that we are going to make. You don't have to. I'll explain why once we get there.

## Let's Code
From now on we'll be coding to render our very own first window to our screen. So let's get started.

**Open the `Source.cpp` file:**

1. First we'll add the libraries that we added to our solution. We'll do that by adding 2 include statements.

        include <glad/glad.h>
        include <GLFW/glfw3.h>

2. Now we'll add the `input output stream` - `iostream` and the standard namespace.

        include <iostream>
        using namespace std;

    We are using `iostream` so that we can read inputs for closing our window. If you want to read any input or output you'll need to use `iostream`.

3. Now that we have added the libraries, we'll delcare two functions. One to handle input and the other one to handle resizing of the window context.

        void FrameBufferSizeCallBack(GLFWwindow* window, int width, int height);
        void ProcessInput(GLFWwindow* window);

    * #### void FrameBufferSizeCallBack(GLFWwindow* window, int width, int height) :

        This function is a callback function used to resize the window.
        
        **Syntax:**

            void function_name(GLFWwindow* window, int width, int height)

        **Parameters:**
        * GLFWwindow* window: This is an opaque window object, provided to us by the GLFW library.
        * int width: The width of the window.
        * int height: The height of the window.

    * #### void ProcessInput(GLFWwindow* window) :

        This function is used to process input for our window. This is a user defined function. We are making this function so as to not clutter our main function.

        **Syntax:**
            
            void function_name(GLFWwindow* window)

        **Parameters:**
        * `GLFWwindow* window` : The object reference of the window for which we want to read the inputs.

4. We have only declared the functions for now. So let's write the definition for what the functions are supposed to do. Let's start with the `FrameBufferSizeCallBack()`.

    * We know that this function is supposed to resize our window. GLFW already has provided us with a function called `glViewport(int x, int y, int width, int height)`

        * #### void glViewport(int x, int y, int width, int height) :
            This function specifies the window coordinates to be drawn onto the screen.

            **Syntax:**

                void glViewport(int x, int y, int width, int height)

            **Parameters:**
            
            * `int x, y` : Specify the x and y coordinates of the lower left corner of the viewport in pixels.
            * `int width, height` : Specify the width and height of the viewport. By default the width and height are set to the dimensions of the window to which this GL Context is attached to.

    * Next function is the function to process input - `ProcessInput()`.
        
        I want to close the window that we are creating when I press the `Esc` button. We will write the code for this inside this function.
            
        Basically all we need to do is write a conditional statement check whether if we are pressing the `Esc` button and if true close the window, or do nothing if it is false.

        So, the code will look like this:

            if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_ESCAPE) == GLFW_PRESS)
            {
                glfwSetWindowShouldClose(window, true);
            }

        
        **Note :** 
        The above snippet is written inside the `ProcessInput()` we declared earlier. The `ProcessInput()` takes in the GLFWwindow* window as a parameter and that window is what we are passing to the `glfwGetKey()` and `glfwSetWindowShouldClose()`.

        The whole thing will look like this:

            void ProcessInput(GLFWwindow* window)
            {
                if (glfwGetKey(window, GLFW_KEY_ESCAPE) == GLFW_PRESS)
                {
                    glfwSetWindowShouldClose(window, true);
                }
            }

        Now let's talk about what `glfwGetKey()` and `glfwSetWindowShouldClose()` does, and also what `GLFW_KEY_ESCAPE` and `GLFW_PRESS` are.

        * #### glfwGetKey() :
            This function is provided to us by the GLFW library. What this function does is it takes the key that we specify and returns the last reported state of that key back to us. 
            
            For example when you press a key and then release it, the key is going through 2 states and those are `key_press` and `key_release`. When you press the key, `key_press` state is reported and the same for `key_release` when you release the key. 
            
            This function simply returns the state when it is reported.

            We want our window to close as soon as we press the `Esc` key, that is why I'm checking if the state of my key is equal to that of a `key_press`, and then calling the function to close the window.

            **Syntax:**

                glfwGetKey(GLFWWindow* window, KeyCode key)

            **Parameters:**
                
            * `GLFWwindow* window` : The object reference of the window for which we want to detect the input.
            * `KeyCode key` : The KeyCode of the key that we want to check for. 
            
                For Example : `GLFW_KEY_ESCAPE` for `Esc` key, `GLFW_KEY_SPACE` for the `SpaceBar` key.

            **Returns:**

            Returns the state of the key passed as a parameter.

            For Example: `GLFW_PRESS` for when key is pressed, `GLFW_RELEASE` for when key is released.
