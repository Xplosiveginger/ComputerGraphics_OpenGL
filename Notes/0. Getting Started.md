# Getting Started
This is a guide for those who want to setup your pc to get started with OpenGL.
This is a beginner guide and so everything will be explained in detail so that everyone who is starting for the first time can understand.

## Setting Up OpenGL
Before we start you need to understand that I'm using 2 libraries specifically `GLFW` and `GLAD`.
As to what these are all you need to know are these contain functions that are precompiled, so that we can use the said functions to make our lives easier.

**Download GLFW**
1. Open your web browser and in the search tab type in `GLFW`.
2. Click on the first link. If you look at top right you'll see a link called `Download`, click on it.

    ```
    Note:

    If you are downloading the source files then you'll need to use external 
    applications like CMake to compile the files for you.

    Since I'm using the precompiled binaries I can't explain how to compile the 
    source code using CMake. But one day I'll update this note to add how to compile 
    source files with CMake.
    ```
